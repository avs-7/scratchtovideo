      <p>[NOT SUPPORTED FOR LINUX/UNIX |PICTURES COMING SOON] This blog is on how to convert a Scratch Project to a Video File. Please note that this is rough, and may not be working as you desired.</p>
      <p>On the Scratch website or application, save the project you would like to convert to a video file. It will save a .sb3 file.</p>
      <p>You will need to download the<a href="https://github.com/RexScratch/sb3tosb2">.sb3(Scratch Project 3.0) to .sb2(Scratch Project 2.0) converter, by RexScratch.</a></p>
      <p>To work the magic of the converter, you will need to install<a href="https://python.org/downloads">Python.</a></p>
      <p>After installing Python, extract the download .zip and click on sb3tosb2.py [Please note that in Mac, right-click on the .py file and select Open with Python Launcher.]</p>
      <p>In the popup file chooser, select your .sb3 file. Please note that if you have audio in your project, it will not convert and you will have to add them manually.</p>
      <p>The .sb2 can be found in the same folder as the .sb3. After that, you will have to install<a href="https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime">Adobe AIR.</a> Scratch 2.0 Editor relies on Adobe AIR to work.</p>
      <p>Once Adobe AIR is installed, install the<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/download/scratch2">Scratch 2.0 Editor.</a> MACOS USERS will either download a .dmg or .air file. Open the .dmg as you would with any other installation .dmg. If you downloaded .air, open the file, which will automatically start the installation.</p>
      <p>Open the .sb2 file. It will open the Scratch 2.0 Editor with your project. In File, select Record Project Video. Do your desired settings for the video and start recording.</p>
      <p>Stop the recording when you want and save the video. It will save as an .flv file. You may either watch it by downloading<a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC Media Player</a> or by converting to .mp4 and watching it with any video player.</p>
